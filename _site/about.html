    <h1>About</h1>
<p>The Weekend Day Centre is a registered charity providing a weekend day care facility for Dementia care.</p>
<p>The centre started in Stockport in December 1991 and achieved charity status in 1993. In 1999 we gained national recognition by being awarded first place in the Carers Scheme category at the Social Care Awards, the first year that these awards were presented.</p>
<p>The prevalence of dementia increases with age. It is currently estimated that there are 3,800 people in Stockport with dementia and it is assumed that if prevalence rates remain the same and the population changes as expected there will be an additional 1,270 people living with dementia by 2025 (Source: Stockport Dementia Strategy).</p>
<p>We offer a wide range of activities to suit all tastes and abilities for people who live with a dementia. Activities include crafts, quizzes, bingo, games and gardening.</p>
<p>The Centre provides external entertainment every afternoon from singers and dancers to choirs and comedians. The Centre celebrates all personal, national and important events including birthdays, anniversaries, mothers’ day and Valentine’s day. Our mornings are spent doing lots of activities, or just sitting quietly if that is preferred – whatever our clients feel like doing.</p>
<p>We take care of any personal care needs as and when required. And we provide breakfast, a 3 course lunch and an afternoon tea.</p>
