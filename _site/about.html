    <h1>About</h1>
<p>The Weekend Day Centre for Dementia Care has vast experience in managing and delivering building based day services for people with a variety of support needs. As an organisation, we have been offering a range of regular activity, educational, developmental and need specific sessions since December 1991, achieving Registered Charity status in 1993.</p>
<p>What started as a weekend day centre has adapted and evolved to meet our clients and their carers needs. We are now open Monday to Friday from 9am until 4pm including Bank Holidays (except Christmas Day), dedicated to supporting people diagnosed with dementia.</p>
<p>We provide an informal social environment for up to 30 clients in which they can feel supported and equipped to maintain their social skills.</p>
<p>We actively encourage carers to attend the Centre to provide them with both a support network and the opportunity to talk to other carers in a relaxed setting.</p>
<p>We offer a wide range of activities to suit all tastes and abilities for people who live with dementia. Activities are pre-planned and scheduled and include quizzes, bingo, games and gardening. Arts and crafts are also available and clients can enjoy these activities with help from staff.</p>
<p>External entertainment is provided every afternoon and includes singers, dancers, choirs and comedians.</p>
<p>The Centre celebrates all personal, national and important events including birthdays, anniversaries, mothers’ day and Valentines’ day. Relatives and friends are always welcome to attend those celebrations if they wish.</p>
<p>A separate room is available for those who would like a bit of peace and quiet.</p>
<p>We recognise that people with dementia require as much exercise as possible therefore short sessions of exercise or dancing are held during the day. This supports improved sleep patterns during the night, as well as eliminating daytime napping.</p>
<p>We are the only day care centre in Stockport specifically for people living with dementia, regardless of age. We acknowledge the differing interests in each gender group and cater for the wide age range of clients we support who are aged from 46 to 96 years old.</p>
