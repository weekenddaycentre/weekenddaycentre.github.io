      <h3>Safeguarding</h3>
      <p>The Weekend Day Centre is committed to safeguarding the well-being of all service users, employees and volunteers who are involved in or affected by our work of delivering building based services. We have robust policies and procedures in place and effective governance to ensure full compliance. Knowledge and awareness of good practices is communicated to all staff through training and supervision.</p>
      <p>All safeguarding practices at the Weekend Day Centre are underpinned by the six safeguarding principles:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Empowerment: People being supported and encouraged to make their own decisions and give informed consent for raising safeguarding concerns.</li>
        <li>Prevention: It is better to take action before harm occurs.</li>
        <li>Proportionality: The least intrusive response appropriate to the risk presented.</li>
        <li>Protection: Support and representation for those in greatest need.</li>
        <li>Partnership: Local solutions through services working with their communities. Communities have a part to play in preventing, detecting and reporting neglect and abuse.</li>
        <li>Accountability: Accountability and transparency in safeguarding practice.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Weekend Day Centre will do this by promoting safeguarding as everyoneâ€™s business and ensure that appropriate legislation is implemented with our people trained to recognise and manage safeguarding concerns.</li>
      <p>All employees and volunteers have a duty to prevent the abuse of adults and report any safeguarding concerns to the relevant person.</li>

      <h3>Net Zero Carbon Reduction Plan</h3>
      <p>We are dedicated to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050, adhering to the principles of the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi). This document presents a set of actions that we are undertaking in the next 12 months to help us reach our targets. This carbon reduction plan also showcases our commitment to transparent reporting and to being accountable for these commitments.
      <h4>Baseline Emissions Footprint</h4>
      <p>In 2025 we plan to record the greenhouse gases that we produce to give us a reference point against which emissions reductions can be measured in readiness for accurate measurement and recording of our emissions carpooling create a more comprehensive year on year plan to achieve Net Zero by 2050
      <h4>Carbon Reduction Initiatives</h4>
      <p>During 2025, we plan to implement a Sustainable Travel Policy to reduce travel where possible and encourage the use of public transport.</p>
      <p>As part of this work, we will explore the feasibility of introducing potential supporting measures such as: Cycle to Work Schemes which can reduce carbon emissions from commuting and promotes healthier lifestyles among our workforce.</p>
      <p>We will also promote carpooling and encourage staff who live close to one another to travel together where other methods of transport are not feasible.</p>
      <p>We will also explore options to reduce our Scope 2 emissions. Options under consideration include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switching to a genuine, high quality renewable electricity tariff.</li>
        <li>Exploring options for workforce climate awareness training.</li>
        <li>We are also considering appointing a formal lead in our team to take responsibility for managing our sustainability initiatives.</li>
