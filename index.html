<p>The Weekend Day Centre provides an informal weekend and bank holiday care facility for people with a formal diagnosis of dementia and their carers within the Stockport borough, including Marple.</p>
<p>We are open every weekend and bank holiday throughout the year (except Christmas Day). The Centre provides day care for up to 40 clients each day; carers are welcome to attend, or to have a break at home for the day.</p>
