<h1>Support & Fundraising</h1>
<p>The Weekend Day Centre relies on donations to continue the work we do. They help us with the ongoing maintenance needed on the building and grounds, as well as budget and plan ahead more effectively for the future so we can commit to supporting more people living with dementia.</p>
<p>The Centre raises awareness at networking meetings and carers’ fairs with other organisations.</p>
<p>The Centre uses badges, key rings and brochures to promote the service for people living with a dementia.</p>
<br>
<p>Your support helps us to make important long-term commitments to improve the service we provide to people living with dementia.</p>
